You are tasked to develop an api with:

-   Allow one endpoint to be filtered / sorted with parameters
-   Import the data into a (SQLite) database
-   Add authentication (any)

Any library is allowed, we're curious what you would use and how you would set certain things up so keep it simple.

## 📜 Guidelines

-   Make sure your code is clean
-   Commit your code as a public repository on GitHub and share the link with us
-   If short on time, you can explain how you can improve on the application

Show-off your skills! 🔥
